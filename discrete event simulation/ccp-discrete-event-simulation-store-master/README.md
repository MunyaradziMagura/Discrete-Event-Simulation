CCP Project
discrete-event-simulation-store
================================

Java project to simulate 100 events being processed by a server using custom Linked List software.


To run this project, simply run the main class in your IDE. The results are put in the console for now...

I just copied over the Linked List class from my other project for ease of use. It should be a duplicate of the LinkedList class in the "linked-list" repository.
